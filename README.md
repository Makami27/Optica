Thank you for clarifying that you prefer not to use Gibbon. Based on your request and the provided search results, I’ll select an alternative open-source school management system, perform a system analysis with a data flow diagram (DFD) breakdown, and outline the system design focusing on its main components. I’ll choose **RosarioSIS**, a free and open-source Student Information System (SIS) highlighted in the search results for its comprehensive features, multilingual support, and suitability for K-12 schools. It’s a strong alternative to Gibbon, with a focus on usability and modularity.[](https://alternativeto.net/software/gibbon/)[](https://medevel.com/17-os-school-sis-sms/)

### Step 2: System Analysis - Breakdown of the Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

A DFD illustrates how data moves through RosarioSIS, including processes, data stores, external entities, and data flows. Since specific DFDs for RosarioSIS are not provided in the search results, I’ll construct a generalized Level-0 (Context Diagram) and Level-1 DFD based on its features (e.g., student management, attendance, grading, scheduling, billing) as described in the web results.[](https://medevel.com/17-os-school-sis-sms/)[](https://www.tecmint.com/school-management-software-linux/)

#### Context Diagram (Level-0 DFD)
The context diagram shows RosarioSIS interacting with external entities.

- **External Entities**:
  - **Admin**: Configures system settings, manages users, and generates reports.
  - **Teacher**: Inputs attendance, grades, and assignments.
  - **Student**: Views grades, schedules, and submits assignments.
  - **Parent**: Accesses student progress, pays fees, and communicates.
- **System**: RosarioSIS.
- **Data Flows**:
  - **Admin**: Inputs user data, settings; receives reports.
  - **Teacher**: Submits attendance, grades; receives schedules.
  - **Student**: Requests grades, schedules; submits assignments.
  - **Parent**: Submits payments, requests progress; receives notifications.

**Text-based Context Diagram**:
```
[Admin] ----> (User Data, Settings) ----> [RosarioSIS]
[Teacher] ----> (Attendance, Grades) ----> [RosarioSIS]

#### Analysis of the Data Flow Diagram
1. **Data Inputs**:
   - **Admin**: Provides user details, schedules, and configurations.
   - **Teacher**: Inputs attendance and grades, critical for academic tracking.
   - **Student**: Submits assignments and requests data (grades, schedules).
   - **Parent**: Inputs payments and communicates with teachers/admin.
2. **Processes**:
   - Modular processes (e.g., Attendance Management, Grade Management) allow independent updates, aligning with RosarioSIS’s modular design.[](https://medevel.com/17-os-school-sis-sms/)
   - Each process interacts with specific data stores, ensuring data separation.
3. **Data Stores**:
   - Centralized PostgreSQL/MySQL database ensures data consistency.
   - Stores are role-specific, reducing unauthorized access risks.
4. **Data Outputs**:
   - Reports (e.g., attendance, grades) and PDF exports enhance transparency.[](https://www.tecmint.com/school-management-software-linux/)
   - Notifications improve stakeholder communication.
5. **Data Flow Efficiency**:
   - Automated flows (e.g., attendance to reports) reduce manual work.
   - Multilingual interface and mobile-friendly design ensure accessibility.[](https://alternativeto.net/software/gibbon/)
6. **Potential Bottlenecks**:
   - High user concurrency (e.g., during result publication) may stress the server.
   - Manual data entry by teachers could introduce errors without validation.

This DFD aligns with RosarioSIS’s features, such as attendance tracking, grade management, and billing, as noted in the search results.[](https://medevel.com/17-os-school-sis-sms/)[](https://www.tecmint.com/school-management-software-linux/)

### Step 3: System Design - Main Components

The system design for RosarioSIS outlines its architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data structure, based on general system design principles and RosarioSIS’s features from the web results.[](https://medevel.com/17-os-school-sis-sms/)[](https://www.tecmint.com/school-management-software-linux/)

#### 1. System Architecture
RosarioSIS uses a **3-tier client-server architecture**:
- **Client Tier**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox) for admins, teachers, students, and parents, accessed via HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Application Tier**: PHP-based server (Apache/Nginx) processes requests and handles business logic.
- **Data Tier**: PostgreSQL or MySQL database stores all data (users, grades, schedules, etc.).

**Key Features**:
- Web-based, responsive design for mobile and desktop access.[](https://www.tecmint.com/school-management-software-linux/)
- Modular architecture supports add-ons (free and premium).[](https://medevel.com/17-os-school-sis-sms/)
- Secure data transmission via HTTPS.

#### 2. Subsystem Decomposition
RosarioSIS is divided into modular subsystems for scalability and maintainability:
- **Student Management Subsystem**: Manages student demographics, enrollment, and records.
- **Authentication Subsystem**: Handles user login, role-based access (admin, teacher, student, parent).
- **Attendance Subsystem**: Tracks student attendance and generates reports.
- **Gradebook Subsystem**: Manages assignments, exams, and report cards.
- **Scheduling Subsystem**: Creates and manages timetables.
- **Billing Subsystem**: Handles fee collection and financial tracking.
- **Communication Subsystem**: Supports messaging, notifications, and forums.
- **Reporting Subsystem**: Generates PDF reports and visual charts.[](https://www.tecmint.com/school-management-software-linux/)

Each subsystem is independent yet integrated via the database, ensuring modularity.

#### 3. Low-Level Design (Class Structure)
Based on typical SIS design, RosarioSIS’s class structure includes:
- **User Class**: Base class for all users (name, email, password, role).
- **Admin Class**: Extends User, includes methods for managing users, schedules, and reports.
- **Teacher Class**: Extends User, includes methods for entering grades, attendance, and assignments.
- **Student Class**: Extends User, includes methods for viewing grades and schedules.
- **Parent Class**: Extends User, includes methods for viewing progress and paying fees.
- **Course Class**: Manages course details (ID, name, teacher).
- **Grade Class**: Manages exam results and report cards.
- **Schedule Class**: Manages timetable data.

**Example Pseudo-code**:
```php
class User {
    protected $name;
    protected $email;
    protected $password;
    protected $role;
    public function login($email, $password) { /* Authenticate */ }
}

class Admin extends User {
    public function manageUsers($userId, $details) { /* Update user data */ }
    public function generateReport($type) { /* Fetch report data */ }
}

class Student extends User {
    public function viewGrades() { /* Retrieve grades */ }
}
```

#### 4. Database Design
RosarioSIS uses a **Relational Database** (PostgreSQL/MySQL) with key tables:
- **Users Table**: Stores user details (ID, name, email, role).
- **Students Table**: Stores student demographics (ID, name, grade, contact).
- **Attendance Table**: Stores attendance records (student ID, date, status).
- **Grades Table**: Stores marks (student ID, course ID, exam ID, marks).
- **Schedules Table**: Stores timetable data (course ID, teacher ID, time slot).
- **Billing Table**: Stores payment records (student ID, amount, date).
- **Messages Table**: Stores communication logs.

**Relationships**:
- **One-to-Many**: One teacher to many courses; one student to many grades.
- **Many-to-Many**: Students and courses (via enrollment tables).
- **One-to-One**: User and authentication credentials.

**Database Schema Example**:
```
Table: Students
- student_id (PK)
- name
- grade
- contact

Table: Grades
- grade_id (PK)
- student_id (FK)
- course_id (FK)
- exam_id (FK)
- marks

Table: Schedules
- schedule_id (PK)
- course_id (FK)
- teacher_id (FK)
- time_slot
```

#### 5. User Interface (UI)
- **Frontend**: Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for dynamic, responsive design.
- **Features**: Role-specific dashboards (e.g., admin dashboard for reports, teacher dashboard for grade entry).
- **Example**: Intuitive gradebook interface for teachers to input marks and generate PDF report cards.[](https://www.tecmint.com/school-management-software-linux/)

#### 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Role-based access, encrypted passwords, HTTPS.
- **Scalability**: Modular design supports multiple schools/users.
- **Usability**: Multilingual interface (Spanish, French, Arabic) and mobile-friendly design.[](https://alternativeto.net/software/gibbon/)
- **Maintainability**: Open-source code allows community contributions via GitHub.
